            Ever since the 1890s Broadway has reigned as the “Great White Way,” the major theatrical centre of the country. New York produces, casts, and consumes the legitimate plays and musical extravaganzas that Americans desire as well as thousands of other shows that only true supporters come to see. Theatre is New York's “fabulous invalid,” periodically near death and at other times revived, and Variety (1905) is the news magazine that informs the world of its health. The city's Off Broadway and Off-Off Broadway venues are where experimental theatre apprentices playwrights, actors, dancers, and directors. In the last decades of the 20th century, major new stages in Times Square, skyscrapers, and a suddenly chic 42nd Street drew new audiences, and the increased price of tickets showed wider interest. For bargain seekers, Manhattan also offers free Shakespeare in Central Park, while cut-rate tickets to current productions are always available. In every borough local groups offer more performances than anyone can attend.

            No city is as recognizable to other Americans as is New York; its glittering nightlife and its gritty neighbourhoods are equally part of the national consciousness. Film directors love to use the city as their set, and city administrations have increasingly encouraged the practice. Until World War I, Queens was the centre of the early film industry, and afterward New York remained vital to documentary and independent film production. Astoria regained its position as a studio centre in the 1980s. It is also fitting that the city that transmitted the first television signals became the setting for many of the most successful TV shows, from I Love Lucy to All in the Family to Seinfeld to Sex and the City to Mad Men to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The Paley Center for Media (1975) in Manhattan allows anyone to recapture famous episodes from this somewhat fictionalized yet also very real New York, and the Museum of the Moving Image (1988) in Queens advances the understanding, enjoyment, and appreciation of the art, history, technique, and technology of film, television, and digital media.
